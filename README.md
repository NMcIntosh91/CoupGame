# CoupGame
My attempt to replicate the very fun card game that is 'Coup'. Essentially, this is a 'what-if' passion project for me to see how good my programming skills
are. I have the basic strucle of the game down but it's not really playable as of yet. The CPU isn't a smart opponenet. It just makes random moves. I almost aim
to improve the inputs.


How to Play Coup
-----------------


Coup is a very fun card game from between 2 - 6 players. It's best player with 3 - 6 players.
Each players is given 2 cards from a shuffled deck. Players can always look at their own cards but must keep them face down in front of them. 
The remaining cards will be in the middle of the play area as the Court deck. Each player starts with 2 coins. Each player's money is visible. 
Place the remaining coins in the middle of the play area as the Treasury.

The end of the game is to be the last person standing. A player's facedown cards represent their roles as well as their lives. Each 
character printed on their face down cards represents a character role and spefific abilites. Each time a player loses a role they must reveal one of their roles
Revealed cards remain face up in front of the player visible to everyone and can no longer be used.

Each player always chooses which of their own cards they wish to reveal when they lose an influence. When a player has lost all their roles they are exiled and out 
of the game. Players take turns doing one action each. Character actions can only be performed when with a player claming to have a certain role. They may be 
telling the truth or bluffing. Character actions can be challenged and then the original player must reveal their claimed role. If the challenge 
fails, the action suceeds after the challenge. The loser of the  challenge lose a character role.
